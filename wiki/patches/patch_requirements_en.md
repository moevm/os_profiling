Step-by-step guide on how to create a patch that they will like:  
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/next/contributor-guide/submit-changes.html

They ask you to test your patches:  
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/next/contributor-guide/submit-changes.html#test-your-changes

Again, they recommend testing the patches yourself:  
https://docs.yoctoproject.org/next/contributor-guide/submit-changes.html#validating-patches-with-patchtest

Where to send patches:  
https://www.yoctoproject.org/community/mailing-lists/

How to write emails to them is described here:

Summary — I wasn’t able to find any strict formal style guide requirements.  
Previously, Yocto, BitBake, and OE had their own wikis, but now it’s all merged into the unified Yocto documentation.  
Example: https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/Styleguide

The Yocto documentation contains no official style guide requirements.  
My assumption is: it’s important not to include ugly hacks, and if your code uses mechanics similar to existing ones — it should be styled accordingly.
