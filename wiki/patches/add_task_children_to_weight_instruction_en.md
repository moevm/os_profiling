# Using Task Children Info for Priority Calculation

To calculate task priorities, child task count was taken into account. The more children a task has, the higher its priority.

The child info comes from `task-children.txt`, which can be generated by performing a regular build and running graph analysis as described in the [instructions](/src/dep_graph/wiki/dep_graph.md).  
The `task-children.txt` file will be located in `src/dep_graph/text-files/` and must be copied to `poky/build/` before building.

Using task children reduced build time from `216m41.635s` to `161m43.487s`.

To enable this feature, apply the patch `add_task_children_to_weight.patch` to  
`/bitbake/lib/bb/runqueue.py`.
