Each chart has two variations -- full and standard.
Each pair of full and standard graphs is plotted for three datasets:
1. wrong_data -- data collected using non-working patches
2. old_data -- data collected on different machines at different times, which is bad for the data
3. new_data -- data collected on the same machine at similar time segments

Also, new_data_night has the data only for nighttime runs
